Hello! My name is Tomek.
I'm a C++/Java software developer.

I have the educational background of Electronics and Telecommunication.
My specialization was/is :) Microprocessor Systems and Programmable Logic Devices.
During last year at my studies I have the chance to start working as a C++ software developer and in very interesting projects.
And that's the way I chose to go :) and I enjoy this professional everyday (with some exceptions along the way that confirm the rule).
